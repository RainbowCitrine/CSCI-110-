# Spring Semester Progress

- This Semester I finally took programming more seriously then I did when I took AP Computer Science A. In all honestly I found myself copying and pasting Java code, since at that time I did not take it serously at all and if anything I had found programming boring during my senior year of high school when I took AP Computer Science A. However, a professor of mine had introduced me to C++ and I found myself dedicated to studying computer science for college and this was my very first semester taking prorgramming classes in college and I feel as though I learned so much more then I did in AP Computer Science A. I learned how to appreciate programming for what it really was and I am very eager to learn how much more C++ has to offer. 


- Computer Science classes in Spring: 
  - CISP 31 (Introduction to C++ programming) 
  - CISP 34 (Advanced C++ programming) 
  - CSCI 110 (Introduction to computer science fundamentals)
